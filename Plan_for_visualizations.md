1) travelling wave: 
- a travelling wave, lets say in AC and strong and weak perturbations which disturb the wave. The result should be that the wave gets shifted, but not distorted. 

2) stochastic dynamics: metastability. Metastability of a AC type equation, but with a 2d double well potential like in the independent studies. Make a gif that tracks the evolution and a figure on the right that tracks the x-coordinate. One should see the flipping. Surely copilot can help with tuning the parameters

3) singular SPDE: the viz. should be a comparision between the bare field and the renormalized field. The bare field should be approximately 0 and the renormalized field should be approximately in one of the two wells.
